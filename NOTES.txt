When adding WOHotKeyCaptureTextField to a window, make sure the window's initialFirstResponder is set to some other control in the window (doesn't have to be a text-based control) so that typing when the window first appears onscreen won't inadvertently set a hot key.

This also enables the "tick" button to correctly resign first responder.

Possibly interesting definitions in system headers/documentation:

- typeEventHotKeyID (10.0+)
- CopySymbolicHotKeys (10.3+)
- kHISymbolicHotKeyCode (10.3+)
- kHISymbolicHotKeyModifiers (10.3+)
- kHISymbolicHotKeyEnabled (10.3+)
- kHIHotKeyModeAllEnabled (10.4+)
- kHIHotKeyModeAllDisabled (10.4+)
- kHIHotKeyModeAllDisabledExceptUniversalAccess (10.4+)
- eventHotKeyExistsErr
